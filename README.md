This respository documents my experience learning Java GUI programming

It contains a Makefile used to compile .java files and remove .class files
quickly in order to keep teh repository clean.

Apart from that, it contains the .java files with my experimentation with Java 
Swing and AWT for GUI programming. The tutorial followed to learn this can be 
found at www.javatpoint.com

After learning the basics of GUI programming, teh experimentation code for whichis stored in the code subdirectory, a project subdirectory will be added to 
contain further subdirectories of basic GUI projects used for practice.
